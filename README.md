# THP-Day11
THP rspec exercises






These exercises were completed with a lot of patience, excitement, some yelling, lots of frustration, but especially with hardheaded stubborness in the face of ridiculous problems by myself and the following contributors. 
This is a team I am happy to work with anyday of the week!
Mathieu Joly, Daniel Stavroff, Vivien Ploix, David Beraud, Stanislas Basquin, Melchior Pedro-Rousselin.
